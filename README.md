Starter app to try out Expo and to answer the question:

What book(s) havenâ€™t I read by author/series/title

So far it just lets you:
* list book titles by author/title/series (exact match only) - enter search text and hit return
* and filter the list by unread
* enter, edit, and delete book details - swipe item left/right for delete/edit (has in-memory storage only)

Used as a starting point:
